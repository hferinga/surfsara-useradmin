      explanation_html: |
        <p>
          As of 1 October 2016, the HPC Cloud login will be replaced by a uniform SURFsara login based on SURFconext technology.
          SURFconext is a national infrastructure by SURF and provides single sign on when used in combination with other
          supported services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have an existing HPC Cloud account you are required to migrate it.
          Otherwise see <a href='https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products'>here</a> for information on SURFsara's resources.
